  <body>When first starting this class, the first few weeks were extremely overwhelming. I didn’t really understand what was going on and one thing that was difficult for me was adding domains because it was one of the first steps you needed in order to do any of your projects and I didn’t really fully understand what a domain was. In order to jump into how to add a domain, I think it would be appropriate to first understand what a domain is. According to google, A domain is essentially your websites equivalent of a physical address. In the same way that a GPS needs a street address or a zip code to provide directions, a web browser needs a domain name to direct you to a website.
