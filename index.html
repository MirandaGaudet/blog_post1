  <body> Before we jump into how to work within shell scripting, I think its important to really get a good grasp on what exactly shell scripting is."A shell script is a computer program designed to be run by the Unix shell, a command-line interpreter". Typical operarions performed bu shell scripts include file manipulation, program execution, and printing text. When strarting to learn shell scripting, it seems very intimidating but the more im using it, its not so bad.
