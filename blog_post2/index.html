  <p>When reading the instructions that were given to us, at times it was hard to comprehend what they were asking. So, if you were stuck on creating the php app like I was, this is the perfect blog to read up on.
  </p>
<p>Like I did in my first blog, I’m going to give a background of what the assignment actually is about before we dive into the steps to achieve your PHP Crud app. There are going to be 6 project file structures that you are going to be doing in order to have your php Crud app running smoothly.
</p>
<p>Step 1: First step… you are going to be preparing the data base. So, what you want to do is go to your phpMyAdmin and create a data base name, something short that you’re going to remember for example, “php_crud”. You always want to make sure the collation is “utf8mb4_general_ci” after this step is complete, hit the “Create” button.
</p>
<p1>Step 2: Next step is you’re going to want to run the SQL code.

-- Table structure for table `products`
--

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `products` (
  `id` int(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `name` varchar(128) NOT NULL,
  `description` text NOT NULL,
  `price` double NOT NULL,
  `created` datetime NOT NULL,
  `modified` timestamp NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  PRIMARY KEY (`id`)
) ENGINE=InnoDB  DEFAULT CHARSET=latin1 AUTO_INCREMENT=9 ;
