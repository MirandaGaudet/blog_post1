<p> When reading the instructions that were given to us, at times it was hard to comprehend what they were asking. So, if you were stuck on creating the PHP app like I was, this is the perfect blog to read up on.
</p>
<p> Like I did in my first blog, I’m going to give a background of what the assignment actually is about before we dive into the steps to achieve your PHP Crud app. There are going to be 6 project file structures that you are going to be doing in order to have your php Crud app running smoothly.
</p>
<p>Step 1: First step… you are going to be preparing the data base. So, what you want to do is go to your phpMyAdmin and create a data base name, something short that you’re going to remember for example, “php_crud”. You always want to make sure the collation is “utf8mb4_general_ci” after this step is complete, hit the “Create” button.
</p>
<p> Step 2: Next step is you’re going to want to run the SQL code. The reason the create this is for the products database <code> --
-- Table structure for table `products`
--

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `products` (
  `id` int(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `name` varchar(128) NOT NULL,
  `description` text NOT NULL,
  `price` double NOT NULL,
  `created` datetime NOT NULL,
  `modified` timestamp NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  PRIMARY KEY (`id`)
) ENGINE=InnoDB  DEFAULT CHARSET=latin1 AUTO_INCREMENT=9 ;

</code>
</p>
<p> 2) Figure out what methods are common to both the primary component and the optional layers. Create a component interface and declare those methods there.
</p>
<p> 3) Create a concrete component class and define the base behavior in it.
</p>
<p>4) Create a base decorator class. It should have a field for storing a reference to a wrapped object. The field should be declared with the component interface type to allow linking to concrete components as well as decorators. The base decorator must delegate all work to the wrapped object.
</p>
<p>5) Make sure all classes implement the component interface.
</p>
<p> 6) Create concrete decorators by extending them from the base decorator. A concrete decorator must execute its behavior before or after the call to the parent method (which always delegates to the wrapped object).
</p>
<p>7) The client code must be responsible for creating decorators and composing them in the way the client needs.
